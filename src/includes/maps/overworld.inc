/** the top left corner metatile is the "blank" tile
 * which is used to fill in anything that falls off the
 * map... tree for a forest, water for an island, black
 * or stone for a cave... 
 * 
 * the map data is made up of 4 bit indices into the tileset
 * specified in the header, eg OverworldTileset
 * so for example here the blank tile is 4 which is the
 * 4th meta tile in the tileset (counting from zero)
